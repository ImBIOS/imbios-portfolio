      `I've been developing frontend web application since I was 15 years old. I didn't know what frontend meant at that time because the term was not coined back then.`,
      `After learning HTML and struggling with CSS and Javascript, I came up with a brilliant idea of using bootstrap so that I don't have to style everything by myself and - for obvious reasons - if you knew bootstrap, you were cool.`,
      `I've been coding in React, Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, MySQL, Bootstrap, Tailwind and C# programming language. Although I barely know the syntax (Psst, Stack overflow!), I consider myself a Ninja developer. (LOL)`,
